Fresh herbs offer one of the most healthy, budget-friendly ways to add flavor to cooking, whether to an omelette or beverage. It can be daunting to get started, but I'm here to share some quick tips and list the steps you need to follow to end up with healthy, thriving herbs for your apartment as soon as next week!

## Step 1: Choosing Herbs

Before we get our seedlings, it's helpful to consider which herbs we want to grow.

- Rosemary and sage are solid options for meat! Rosemary is excellent in soups, stews, and with beef. Sage is a classic with pork.
- Mint, oregano, and thyme are hardy, virtually unkillable herbs. They go great on many dishes and can be counted on for constant production.
- Explore a new cuisine by growing their favorite herbs! Explore Italian flavors by growing basil or parsley. Alternatively, dive into French cuisine with tarragon!

## Step 2: Repot Seedlings

Getting started with growing herbs at home is as easy as going to the nursery for healthy transplants. Thanks to the work of greenhouses like [Rocket Farms](https://rocketfarms.com/product-category/potted-herbs/), you don't need a clean, well-run greenhouse to have mature transplants any time of year. With our herbs in mind, make a trip to a local plant nursery for healthy transplants that are ready to go.

To give our seedlings the best chance, the first and most important thing for us to do will be to repot it in fresh, good quality potting mix and water deeply. Otherwise, your plant may become rootbound, which stunts further growth.

## Step 3: Care & Feeding

- Many soil mixes will become dry and hard to wet if allowed to dry out fully. When this happens, water will run over the soil without actually watering it, leaving your plants badly parched and unable to thrive. To fix it, water your plant slowly under dripping water and rub water into the soil mix, until there are no more dry, flaky clumps.
- Greenhouse herbs are used to a constant feeding schedule, which many new owners often fail to keep up! Try a balanced time-release fertilizer, using just a small dose as herbs are light feeders.
